Measuring tension using FFT transformation. FFT is The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is a faster version of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT) that takes advantage of algebraic properties and periodicities in sines to perform calculations. By organizing redundant computations in an efficient manner, the FFT reduces the total amount of calculations required. It decomposes a large data set into smaller data sets and performs calculations on these smaller sets. The FFT is N/log2(N) times faster than the DFT, making it more practical to use in many applications.
